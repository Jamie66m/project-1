# Overview 

Hogwarts Invaders was the first project that I completed during a 3 month Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly. 

With only three weeks into the course and being a complete novice before the start I was extremely excited about taking on first front-end development project. 

The task was to create a grid-based game and we were to choose a game from a selection of 10. All the games were given a level of difficulty between 1-3. These games were to utilise 'vanilla' JavaScript, HTML and CSS

Hogwarts Invaders is a level 2 grid-based game which is a take on the iconic _Space Invaders_. This was a solo project with a duration of one week. The aim was to translate the key aspects of Harry Potter into the game and so I focused heavily on animations, using set intervals and timeouts, and also the use of sound effects to create a sense of suspense and intensity around the game. 

I knew this was going to be a challenge due to my very basic understanding of JavaScript and interacting with the DOM, but I was comfortable in my understanding of CSS to make sure the user had a fun and entertaining experience when playing the game.

## The Brief

- **Render a game in the browser**
- **Design logic for winning & visually display which player won**
- **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
- Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
- Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**
- **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
